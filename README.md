# Quehora
A French app, similar to other tourism applications in France, was deployed to help people discover attractions, show the level of crowding at tourist spots based on Google traffic data and user feedback, and also provide rewards and discounts in different parts of Paris.

Our team was responsible for updating this application in three consecutive phases, which included delivering both Android and iOS versions, as well as implementing changes in Firebase and its functions.
